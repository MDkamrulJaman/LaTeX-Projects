\section{Introduction}
The rise of e-commerce has transformed the way people buy and sell goods and services. As
more people turn to online shopping, there is a growing need for e-commerce platforms that
are secure, efficient, and decentralized. In response to this need, a Decentralized E-commerce
Platform (DECP) has been developed to facilitate e-commerce transactions in a more secure
and efficient manner.
The DECP is designed to be a decentralized platform that eliminates the need for
intermediaries such as banks and payment processors. It is built on a blockchain technology
that allows for secure and transparent transactions between buyers and sellers. With the
DECP, buyers and sellers can conduct transactions without having to worry about the risk of
fraud, as the platform ensures that all transactions are transparent and verifiable.
This lab report will discuss the design and implementation of the DECP, including the features
and benefits of the platform. Additionally, it will provide an analysis of the platformâ€™s
performance and potential use cases in the e-commerce industry

\section{Implementation}

 \textbf{Decentralized Network:} 
The first step in implementing a decentralized e-commerce platform is to establish a decentralized network. This can be achieved through the use of blockchain technology, which provides a distributed database that can be used to record and verify transactions. The decentralized network should be able to handle large volumes of transactions, ensure data privacy, and prevent double-spending.

\textbf{User Registration and Authentication:}
Once the decentralized network is established, the platform should allow users to register and authenticate themselves securely. The platform should use a decentralized identity system such as self-sovereign identity (SSI) to ensure the validity of user information. Users should be able to create accounts with their personal information and login credentials. The registration process should include email verification to ensure the validity of the user's email address.

\textbf{Product Management:}
The platform should allow vendors to upload their products for sale, including product descriptions, images, and pricing information. The product information should be stored on the decentralized network to ensure transparency and prevent tampering.

\textbf{Order Management:}
The platform should allow users to place orders for products, and vendors should be able to manage their orders. The platform should use smart contracts to automate the order management process, including payment processing and delivery tracking. The smart contracts should be stored on the decentralized network to ensure transparency and prevent tampering.\\


\textbf{Payment Processing:}
The platform should allow users to make payments using a variety of payment methods, including cryptocurrencies and traditional payment methods. The platform should use a decentralized payment system such as a blockchain-based payment system to ensure security and transparency.


\vspace{1cm}

\textbf{SDLC Models}

Selecting the right software development life cycle (SDLC) model is a crucial decision that can have a significant impact on the success of a software development project.

For a Decentralized E-commerce Platform, the Agile SDLC model is likely the most suitable choice. The Agile model is designed to be flexible and adaptive, which is particularly important for a decentralized platform, where requirements can change frequently. The Agile model is ideal for software development projects that require frequent iterations and updates, as well as continuous feedback from stakeholders.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=8cm]{model/Screenshot from 2023-05-15 19-51-13.png}
    \caption{Agile Model}
    \label{fig:enter-label}
\end{figure}

In an Agile SDLC model, the development process is broken down into small iterations or sprints, where the team works on a specific set of tasks and delivers a working product at the end of each sprint. The Agile model allows for changes and updates to be made quickly and easily, which is particularly important for a Decentralized E-commerce Platform that requires constant updates to stay competitive in the marketplace.\\

 \section{Data Flow Diagram}

A data flow diagram shows how data moves through an information system graphically. It may show the flow of stored data as well as incoming and outgoing data. The DFD makes no reference to how data moves around the system. It is a well-known visual illustration of how information moves through a system. A

clean and obvious DFD can graphically represent the appropriate quantity of the system need. It demonstrates how information enters and exits the system, what modifies the data, and where information is kept.
DFD and Flowchart differ significantly from one another. The flowchart shows how program modules' control flows. DFDs represent the different levels of data flow in the system. There are no branch or control elements in DFD.
 
 A decentralized e-commerce platform is a platform where buyers and sellers can connect without the need for intermediaries. A platform should have:

\begin{enumerate}
        \item User Registration: The platform should allow users to register themselves as either buyers or sellers. \\
    
    \item User Profile: The platform should allow users to create and edit their profiles with details such as name, contact information, address, and payment details. \\

    \item  Product Catalog: The platform should have a catalog of products that are available for purchase. This catalog should be searchable and filterable.

\item Product Listing: Sellers should be able to create listings for their products. They should be able to add details such as product name, description, images, price, and shipping information
\item Product Management: Sellers should be able to manage their listings. They should be able to edit, delete, or mark their listings as sold.
\item Order Management: The platform should allow buyers to place orders for products. Sellers should be able to view and manage orders, mark orders as shipped, and communicate with buyers regarding the status of their orders.
\item Payment Gateway: The platform should integrate with a payment gateway to facilitate transactions between buyers and sellers.
\item Rating and Reviews: The platform should allow buyers to rate and review products and sellers. This feedback can help other buyers make informed decisions.
\item Messaging System: The platform should have a messaging system that allows buyers and sellers to communicate with each other.
